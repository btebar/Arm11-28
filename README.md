# Arm11-28
First Year End of Year project
This was the project we did at the end of our first year at Imperial College London. We had to simulate the process 
executed by the cpu of a machine, taking into account the space(memory), and the registers available. In both the assembler 
and emulator the main part was to interpret instructions, either in binary or architecture language.
I collaborated with Niranjan Bhat, Nahida Chiki and Giovanni Passerello, all Imperial College students.
